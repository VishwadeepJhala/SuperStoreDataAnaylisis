Hello Everyone
Being part of Alphaa AI fellowship I tried to learn and analyze small stories behind the dataset. 
I have prepared a dashboard for the superstore owner and manager.
I tried analyzing the story behind data and even tried to bring out stories from data.

This task was very insightful and interesting and i wouldn't have been able to do this without @saurabh sir and @preksha ma'am. If you want to do something like this as well, join the largest Citizen Data Scientist community ðŸ‘‰ http://bit.ly/fellow-9.

I was able to come to certain conclusions such as :
1. Even few product lies in Top 5 product by sales still its creating loss .
2. Profit is always low in Nov in all 4 years .
3. If we offer discount more than 30% it incours loss .
4. In shipping days schedule to ship product is 4 and 5 but in actual its taking 6 days for majority of product.

And by the way would you believe that all this is built using EXCEL !!
